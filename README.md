#My First Repo#

##Scope##
- this is just a practice repo
- experiment with markdown
- familiarize with github features and basic commands

###Practice Repo###
- hardly any actual code here
- I will probably experiment with shell scripts in 2nd repo

###Experiment with Markdown###
1. style with *italics*
2. style with **bold**
3. use inline code like `git add -A`
4. use a block of code
```
for $i in {1..10}
do
	touch file$i.txt 
	mv file$i.txt ~/Documents
done
```
